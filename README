minecount - count blocks and items on a minecraft world
Copyright © 2011-2013 Jesús A. Álvarez

The command line utility will count everything in a minecraft world and save
it in a json file. Features:
 * Count world blocks, containers and/or inventories
 * Multi-threaded
 * Search for specific items and return their position
 * Limit search/count to a certain area
 * Cross platform (tested on Mac OS X, Linux and Windows)

usage: minecount -[wciv] [-t threads] [-f find] [-b bounds] world output
 -w: include world blocks
 -c: include chest/dispenser contents
 -i: include player inventories
 -v: verbose
 -t threads: number of threads to run (defaults to the number of CPU cores)
 -f 1,2,3: find items and report their position
 -b x,y,z x,y,z: count only in specified bounds

The web interface will display the results in a webpage, including the 
difference in blocks from the previous day. It is designed to keep daily count
of more than one world, with the json files in count/<world>/<yyyy-mm-dd>, and
uses PHP to generate the file list, but if you don't have PHP, you can put the
file list in a static json file and update it manually.
